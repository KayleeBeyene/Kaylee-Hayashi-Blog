Hello internet, my name is Kaylee.

I got this skateboard at Sled Island, which is a music festival here in Calgary. They were hosting an event at the Source, which is a local skate shop. And, It was an all-girls thing. There were hotdogs, drinks, and ramps, it was super cool. We skated in the back alley, which was pretty rocky but, it was still a lot of fun. They even built me this board. it has some coloured hardware, Mob griptape. All I needed was to tighten the trucks, and that was it! We skated. I also met some cool girls there and got some Instagram pics. It was really great! I probably haven’t skated in the past 4 or 5 years but this got me back on the board.

So, I’ll give you some background first.

I’ve always loved skating since I was a kid. Around 11 or 12 is when I started. I fell in love with the culture and the community around it. Now, I’m not really a rebellious person but, when I was skateboarding, I got to embody a rebellious mind. Like, I didn’t get into trouble or anything but, I got to do things that I wouldn’t normally do and think in a way that I didn’t normally think. And that is what I love about skateboarding. It expands your mind. It really teaches you to push yourself. Like when you’re learning a new trick, you have to get over the fear of falling over. And you have to do it over and over and over. It’s like Aaron Kyro says “You’ve gotta go fast and commit”. Becasue if you don’t commit, you’re not likely to land the trick. So, even if you’re scared of falling down, you’ve just gotta get over that and commit to the trick anyways. And so, in that way, skateboarding really teaches you how to get over your fears and how to push yourself to really improve.

Well, anyways, that’s what I learnt this month. I hope you enjoyed the video, I hope you got something out of it. And if you’re looking for a new hobby, why not try skateboarding? And if you’re scared you *can* wear pads. It’s nothing to be ashamed about. Who cares what the other people think about you? We’re all there just to have fun. Anyways, I’ll see you in the next one! Bye!
